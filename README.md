# Digit-Prediction
ðŸš€ Successfully Built and Deployed an Image Classification Model! ðŸŽ‰  We developed a deep learning model using Keras and Streamlit, achieving an impressive 99.5% accuracy on the MNIST dataset! This dataset consists of 70,000 handwritten digit images (28x28 grayscale), and our model effectively classifies them with near-perfect precision.
